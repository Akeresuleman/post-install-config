<p>
After a succeful installation of osticket, browse the helpdesk login page and created the help desk name, admin user and data base information. I then logged in as admin to the admin panel configured and added roles, departments, teams and agents. I also managed and added three SLA and help topics. Further more I switched to the agent panel and added two users
